## System Architecture

The Menu Management System follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: Contains API definitions and type interfaces for CRUD operations
- **Data Layer**: Implements data fetching and manipulation using React Query
- **UI Components Layer**: Reusable components for rendering and interaction
- **Page Layer**: Main page component that coordinates components and operations

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Forms**: Custom Form component and field validation
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

## Key Components

### API Layer

`/frontend/src/api/menu.ts`
- Defines type interfaces (`MenuDto`, `CreateMenuDto`, `UpdateMenuDto`)
- Implements API endpoints for CRUD operations

### Data Layer

`/frontend/src/hooks/useMenu.ts`
- Custom hook for menu data management
- Uses React Query for caching and data synchronization
- Provides functions for all menu operations (fetch, create, update, delete)

### UI Components

1. **Table Component** - `/frontend/src/components/Table.tsx`
   - Generic table component with sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Used to display menu data in a structured format

2. **Form Component** - `/frontend/src/components/Form.tsx`
   - Generic form component that supports multiple field types and validation
   - Handles form state and submission

3. **MenuForm** - `/frontend/src/components/menu/MenuForm.tsx`
   - Specialized form for menu items using the generic Form component
   - Handles menu-specific validation and field rendering

4. **MenuEditModal** - `/frontend/src/components/menu/MenuEditModal.tsx`
   - Modal dialog for creating and editing menu items
   - Integrates with the menu hook for data operations

### Page Component

`/frontend/src/pages/system/MenuManagement.tsx`
- Main page component for menu management
- Integrates the Table component for displaying menu data
- Provides functionality for adding, editing, and deleting menu items
- Implements hierarchical menu display with level information

## Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - `useMenu` hook retrieves menu data using React Query
   - Data is cached and automatically refreshed when mutations occur

2. **Data Display**:
   - Menu data is flattened into a hierarchical structure for display
   - Table component renders menu items with appropriate formatting

3. **Data Modification**:
   - Edit actions open the MenuEditModal
   - Form data is collected and validated
   - API calls are made through the useMenu hook
   - React Query invalidates queries to refresh the data

## Implementation Details

### Menu Structure

Menus are implemented as a hierarchical structure with three types:
- **DIRECTORY**: Container for other menu items
- **MENU**: Navigable menu item
- **BUTTON**: Permission-controlled action item

Each menu item includes:
- Basic properties (name, path, icon, etc.)
- Ordering information
- Visibility/permission settings
- Metadata for rendering

### Table Implementation

The Table component in MenuManagement:
- Defines columns with appropriate renderers
- Supports sorting by name, path, and order
- Displays hierarchical data with indentation
- Includes action buttons for edit, add, delete operations

### Menu Forms

The menu form implementation:
- Validates required fields
- Adapts displayed fields based on menu type
- Prevents circular references in parent selection
- Manages complex nested metadata

## Enhancements and Optimizations

### Table Component Integration

The original implementation used Chakra UI's Table directly. The enhancements include:

1. **Replaced with Generic Table Component**:
   - Improved code reusability
   - Added built-in sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Enhanced type safety with column definitions

2. **Hierarchical Display**:
   - Implemented level-based indentation
   - Added visual indicators for parent-child relationships
   - Improved readability of nested menu structures

### Form Component Integration

The original form implementation used react-hook-form directly with Chakra UI components. The enhancements include:

1. **Replaced with Generic Form Component**:
   - Simplified form creation with declarative field definitions
   - Reduced boilerplate code
   - Improved consistency across different forms
   - Centralized form state management and validation

2. **Improved Field Management**:
   - Dynamically generated field options
   - Conditional field rendering based on form state
   - Better handling of complex nested fields

### Code Modularity

1. **Enhanced Component Structure**:
   - Clear separation between generic and specialized components
   - Improved component reusability
   - Better type definitions

2. **Optimized Data Flow**:
   - Centralized data management in custom hooks
   - Reduced prop drilling
   - More consistent state updates

## Future Development

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Add Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
   - Implement visual drag-and-drop for menu reordering
   - Update order numbers automatically

2. **Add Search and Advanced Filtering**:
   - Implement search functionality for large menu structures
   - Add filters for menu types, visibility, etc.

3. **Improve Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Enhance form validation rules
   - Provide more detailed error messages
   - Add confirmation for destructive actions

4. **Enhance Visual Feedback**:
   - Add animations for menu state changes
   - Improve loading and error states
   - Add tooltips for complex actions

### Integration Points

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Integrate with permission system
   - Restrict menu actions based on user roles
   - Preview menu visibility for different roles

2. **Audit Logging**:
   - Track menu changes
   - Implement history and restore functionality

## Conclusion

The Menu Management System implements a complete solution for managing application menus. It follows best practices for React development including component modularity, type safety, and optimized state management. The system is ready for further enhancements and integration with other parts of the application.
